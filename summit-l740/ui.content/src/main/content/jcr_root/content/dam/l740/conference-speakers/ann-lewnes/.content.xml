This admission and her passion for creativity and media still drive her as Adobe’s CMO and are reflected in the company’s groundbreaking marketing campaigns. Creativity is only half the equation, as under Ann’s leadership, Adobe’s marketing organization has pioneered the shift to digital — deploying a comprehensive set of digital marketing solutions, establishing an insight-driven culture, and setting a template for marketing’s strategic impact on business. Prior to Adobe, Ann spent 20 years building the Intel brand as a VP of Marketing. Ann serves on the board of Mattel. She has been inducted into the American Marketing Association’s Hall of Fame, named one of the most innovative and influential CMOs by Business Insider and Forbes, and recognized on AdWeek 50, a celebration of indispensable marketing and media executives. In 2015, Ad Age named her to The Creativity 50, honoring the most creative people of the year.&lt;/p>&#xa;&lt;p>If Ann were not at Adobe, she’d be a roadie for a band.&lt;/p>&#xa;"
